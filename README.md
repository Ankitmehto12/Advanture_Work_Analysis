# Advanture_Work_Analysis


## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow** using Python, SQL concepts, and BI tools. The goal is to extract insights from raw data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization, and then present findings through a professional **Power BI dashboard**, a **written report**, and a **presentation (PPT created using Gamma)**.

This project is designed to showcase practical data analytics skills in a clear and recruiter-friendly manner.

## Dataset

* **Source:** Public / sample dataset (CSV format)
* **Type:** Structured tabular data
* **Size:** Medium-sized dataset suitable for analysis
* **Description:** Contains multiple features including numerical and categorical columns used to analyze trends, patterns, and performance metrics.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Data loading, EDA, and cleaning

  * Libraries: Pandas 
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Analysis and documentation

* **Gamma:** PPT / presentation creation
* **Excel / CSV:** Data source format

---

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas
   * Performed initial inspection (shape, columns, data types)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Summary statistics and distributions
   * Missing value analysis
   * Outlier detection
   * Correlation analysis and visual exploration

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing values
   * Removed or treated outliers
   * Converted data types where required
   * Created new calculated columns for better insights

4. **Data Export for BI**

   * Cleaned dataset exported for Power BI usage

5. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**

   * Built interactive visuals and KPIs
   * Added filters and slicers for better user interaction

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a concise analytical report summarizing insights
   * Designed a professional PPT using **Gamma** to present findings

---

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis using charts
* Category-wise and time-based comparisons
* Interactive filters for dynamic exploration

The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand insights and make data-driven decisions.

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns in the data
* Highlighted high-performing and low-performing segments
* Discovered correlations between important variables
* Provided actionable insights supported by visuals

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells step by step
4. Use the cleaned dataset file to build or view the Power BI dashboard
5. Review the final report and PPT created using Gamma

---

## Key Takeaways

* Demonstrates complete data analytics lifecycle
* Strong focus on practical, real-world analysis
* Combines technical analysis with clear storytelling
